Answers to all the questons..........



1 ,* Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions. 
    * Rules  for the use of whitespace, indentation and comments. 
    * Programming practices and principles.

2, Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects.


3 ,The .random() method is used to generate a random number between 0 to 1. 

4, The sort() method is used to sort the array. An array can be string, number or character etc.

5, The .reverse() method reverses the order of the elements in an array.

6, Bad JS examples:

1;  var InvId=”1001”;
    
     Function invGen() {
} 

2; 1==”1”; // true
False== “ nt “; // true
[ [ ] , [ ] ] == true; // true



7, A JASON object can contain 6 data types: 

Object, Arrays, Strings, Number, Booleans and Null.

8, Minifying JavaScript is to remove whitespaces, strips comments, combine files, and shortens a few common programming patterns.


9, A global variable has global scope  which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. And global variables can easily be overwritten.
